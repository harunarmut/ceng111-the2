THE2 - python

It is an take home exam which is coded with Python2.7


This exam is about determining properties of line segments and polygons with three or four edges.Let us call a three or four edged polygon (a triangle or a quadrilateral) as aminority-shape. A minority-shapeis described by a list of vertices such that the vertices are placed in the list in the order of acounter-clockwisetraversal of the vertices on the shape.  However, no specification of the starting vertex is given, which suggeststhat, with such a representation, generally speaking, a minority-shape withnvertices could be represented byndifferent lists.  Avertexis represented as a tuple of two floating point numbers, i.e., as (x,y), wherexandyare the horizontal and vertical coordinates, respectively.
